        PahadSuraksha combines live weather data, terrain characteristics, historical incidents, and community
        reports from the eight North Eastern states into a regional risk picture. It helps MDoNER and state
        authorities identify vulnerable zones early and coordinate preventive action before disasters occur.

        The platform supports citizens and travellers checking conditions, field teams reporting incidents, and
        government decision-makers who need an aggregated, district-wise view of emerging risk and disrupted
        connectivity.
